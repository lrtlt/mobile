# LRT.LT

React Native mobile application for [www.lrt.lt](https://www.lrt.lt/) website.

## How to build project

```Note that you can build iOS app only if youre running on macOS.```

Before you start you have to have all required tools installed based on your machine.

You can find all information [here](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started) under **React Native CLI Quickstart** tab.




Once you have all  the tools installed open youre IDE (we prefer VSCode) and run one of the scripts below:

```yarn run-android```  - build & run android application
